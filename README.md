# Food Truck Project

### Overview
This program allows users to input a number of Food Trucks that they wish to rate
on a scale of 1 to 5 as well as including the name of said truck and what type of
food they serve as well as displaying the highest rated truck and average ratings
of all trucks listed.

### Technologies Used
• Java
• For Loops
• If Statements
• Arrays
• Switches

### How To Run
Begin program as a Java application. The user will be greeted into the program
and asked to input how many trucks they would like to rate. The user will then
be prompted to enter the first trucks name, type of food, and how they would
rate it on a scale of one to five. Once the user has completed entering their
data they will be sent to the main menu (This can also be achieved by typing
'quit' into the name of a truck). The user will now be able to navigate using
the menu to either view all truck data, view the average ratings, view the
highest rated, or quit program.

### Lessons Learned
Positive: This week I feel as though I am a mile ahead of where I was just
one week ago. That being said, I know I am just barely getting my toes in the
water of this skill. I was able to get this program functional with quite a bit
of trial and error but I am excited with the outcome. It could likely still use
some refining so please let me know what I can do better in the future!

Negative: The biggest obstacle at the start of this project was getting my two
classes to communicate properly and work together the way I wanted. Once I
figured out that aspect the remaining pieces fell together one by one. My second
biggest obstacle was my opening command prompts. The For loop was working as
intended but the nextInt(); and nextLine(); methods were causing trouble with
user input fields being skipped and for the life of me I could not get them to
play nice. Though my workaround isn't exactly pretty it got the job done and my
initial prompts work great!
